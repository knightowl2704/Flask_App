# Flask_App

This repo is a web app that is developed using **Flask** framework and hosted on local machine. 

Currently it is just a simple sign up form with basic validators.
The app is supported by *flask_wtf* module for creating and validating forms.
The app form also has a built-in *reCAPTCHA* for validation.
